# GSAP Animation Demo

This repository showcases a simple webpage with animations using [GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)](https://greensock.com/gsap/). The project demonstrates how to animate text and elements on the page with smooth transitions and effects.

## Features

- **Smooth text animations**: Animations for the main heading and navigation items that appear from the top with fading effects.
- **Responsive design**: The layout adjusts to various screen sizes, with a hero section that stays centered on the screen.
- **GSAP integration**: Used GSAP to create animations for the `h1` tag, `li` elements, and `.hero` div.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Markup for structuring the content of the page.
- **CSS3**: Styles for page layout and design.
- **GSAP**: JavaScript library for high-performance animations.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

## GSAP Timeline Project 🎨

Welcome to my GSAP Timeline project! This repository demonstrates the power and flexibility of gsap.timeline(), an incredible feature from the GreenSock Animation Platform (GSAP) that makes building beautiful, dynamic animations a breeze.

Whether you’re an animation enthusiast or a developer seeking inspiration, this project will guide you through the seamless possibilities of GSAP's timeline-based animations.

🚀 About gsap.timeline()
The gsap.timeline() feature is a powerful tool for managing animations. It lets you:

Chain animations: Create smooth sequences where animations follow one another in order.
Stagger effects: Easily delay and overlap elements for stunning visuals.
Simplify controls: Manage an entire sequence using play, pause, or reverse, all with a single timeline.
This makes gsap.timeline() perfect for storytelling, engaging UI transitions, and managing complex animations with ease.

✨ Project Features
Here’s what this project includes:

🎯 Dynamic Animations:
Smooth transitions for text and elements.
Staggered animations to create a rhythmic feel.
🛠 Customizable Timeline:
Easily adjust the timing, duration, and order of animations.
💻 Responsive Design:
Built to look stunning across all devices.
🛠️ Code in Action
Here’s an example of how gsap.timeline() is used in this project:

javascript
Copy code
var tl = gsap.timeline();

// Animate the header
tl.from("h1", {
y: -30,
opacity: 0,
duration: 1,
delay: 0.25,
});

// Animate the navigation links
tl.from("li", {
y: -30,
opacity: 0,
duration: 1,
delay: 0.5,
stagger: 0.3,
});

// Animate the hero section
tl.from(".hero", {
y: 30,
opacity: 0,
duration: 1,
delay: 1,
});
